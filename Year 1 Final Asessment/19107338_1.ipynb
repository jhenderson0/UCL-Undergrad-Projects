    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task I will be creating a clone of the popular game angry birds using the Vpython module for python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this game I will attempt to simulate the physics of 2D motion under gravity and elastic collisions. The aim is to have a system in which a 'bird' is fired by the user at a target. If the user hits the target then the resulting torque is calculated. If this torque is greater than the restoring force then the target will topple and the user will win. Key sections of the code will be explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The game loops\n",
    "\n",
    "My game is composed of 3 loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'go' loop:\n",
    "This loop is the main loop in which most of the game code is enclosed. There is an input variable which allows to user to decide if they want to play the game or not. The start of this loop is returned to when the user has either hit or missed the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'start' loop:\n",
    "This is an introduction loop. The user is shown the game scene and asked for a value of v0 and theta. The user is then show the momentum vector these values will produce and given the option to continue or re-enter v0 and theta values. If the user choses to continue then the loop will be broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'run_game' loop:\n",
    "This loop runs the animation of the bird undergoing 2D motion and contains a collision detection section. Once the bird has hit or missed the target the loop will break returning the user to the start of the go loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions used\n",
    "I found this game had limited need for functions as very few lines of code were repeated. Only two functions were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'update_momentum' function:\n",
    "This function takes in the user's values for v0 and theta and calculates the bird's momentum at time t. An arrow is then created with a start position on the surface of the bird and pointing in the direction of the bird's momentum. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the bird's momentum. This function is used in both the intro section, to give the user a hint of the direction the bird will travel in, and the main animation section in which it is updated along with bird's position as time increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'update_end_text' function:\n",
    "This function takes in a range of possible end game text strings and displays them to the user as label. This function is used for each possible outcome of the game: the bird misses, the bird hits but the target stays upright or the bird hits and the target topples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The physics\n",
    "There are two main physics sections in this game both using equations from [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2D motion:\n",
    "This section uses the equations shown in [2,pp.2]. The users inputs of v0 and theta are used to calculate the new position and momentum of the bird as time is increased by a set time step. These equations are continually implemented until the bird either hits the target or the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision with the target:\n",
    "This section uses the equations shown in [2,pp.3-4]. After the target is hit the applied force is calculated from the bird's momentum at this time. This collision point is assumed to be the bird's position at this time so the distance vector is the just the position of the bird minus the position of the target's bottom right hand corner. The applied torque is then calculated. If this is greater than the restoring torque then the target will topple and the user will win. The target is rotated by 90 degrees [1] to show it falling. If the target doesn't topple then the user is given the chance to play again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect collisions I had to check the birds position relative to the floor and the target. When checking for collisions with the floor I made it conditional that the birds y position was greater than 0.3. This meant that if the bottom of the ball hit the ground it would count as a collision. If the bird's x position was found to be greater than the distance to the target plus the target's width but was not at a height less then or equal to the targets height then the shot was treated as a miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For target collisions the condition was that the birds x position was greater than or equal to the target's distance and the birds y position was less than or equal to the targets height. This collision was included in an elif statement as it was possible both these statements were true but the bird had just overshot as mentioned above. \n"

    "### Assumptions and improvements \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the specification [2,pp.2-3] there are certain physical assumption made in order to simplify the simulation. However there are a few other assumptions made. There were also certain improvements which could be added to the game to increase the physical accuracy and game play.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The contact point of the bird and the target is given by the birds x and y position. This means the bird acts as a point mass and can be seen clipping into the target once it has hit. This is because the simulation waits until the center of the bird collides with the wall. Initially I was going to add an offset of 0.3 in the x direction to this value to compensate for the birds radius. However, I then noticed that if the bird hit the top of the wall then this offset would need to be included in the y direction instead. A third condition would also be needed for if the bird hit the left hand corner of the target with an offset needing to be included in both directions. I therefore decided to keep the bird as a point mass as it worked best to show the physics of the system. However adding this in would increase the visuals of this game and make it more user friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The target can't wobble. In reality the target could return to its upright position and then topple slightly in the other direction. This would require the lower left corner of the target to also be considered as a point of rotation. This would increase the physical accuracy of the game and add more interesting game play scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A really interesting improvement would be to add a catapult system. This would allow the user to click and drag on the bird, pulling it back from its original position. The distance pulled back would be proportional to the initial velocity of the bird. While the negative value of the angle between the vector passing through the original position of the ball and the vector joining the new position of the bird to its original position would be theta. This would improve game play and make the controls more user friendly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* I considered putting restrictions on values of theta and v0. This would ensure a player can't fire the bird backwards or have such a high value of of v0 that the simulation fails to keep up or hitting the target becomes too easy. However, as the main function of this game is to act as a physical simulation I decided not to add any restrictions so the way in which the simulation acts under extreme values can be explored."
